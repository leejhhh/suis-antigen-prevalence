### S. suis Antigen Prevalence – Concise Methods (for duplication section)

 all complete and near-complete *Streptococcus suis* assemblies in RefSeq (taxid 1307) were downloaded (n = 402). After removing duplicate BioSample IDs and assemblies < 500 kb, 388 genomes (183 serotype-annotated, 205 untyped) were retained; each *.fna* file was kept exactly as published.

The 388 sequences were concatenated into *all_suis_genomes.fna* and converted to a nucleotide BLAST database with **makeblastdb** (BLAST+ v2.15.0, `-dbtype nucl -parse_seqids`) [1, 2]. Five candidate antigens—HP0197, Fnbp, Sao, C5a-peptidase (ScpB) and Suilysin—and their conserved-domain fragments were compiled in *query_antigens.fasta* and *query_antigens_highlight.fasta*.

Protein queries were searched against the six-frame-translated database with **tblastn** (`-evalue 1e-5 -outfmt 6 -num_threads $(nproc)`). Hits were filtered at either ≥ 70 % identity & ≥ 80 % query-coverage (full length) or ≥ 60 % identity & ≥ 50 % coverage (highlight fragments). A genome was counted as positive if it contained ≥ 1 hit passing these criteria; thresholds were selected to balance sensitivity and specificity and follow previous cross-serotype work in streptococci [6]. Prevalence was reported as (number of positive genomes / 388) × 100.

All scripts (SSUIS-SADE v1.0.0), *environment.yml* and a Dockerfile (Ubuntu 22.04) are available on GitHub; the entire analysis reproduces with a single command `bash run_suis_prevalence.sh` once the 388 *.fna* files are placed in *suis_selected/*.
